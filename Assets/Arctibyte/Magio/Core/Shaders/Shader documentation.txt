The shader properties are generally used through script, 
but here is a small documentation to get you started in case you want to customize the shader.

_BaseMap to _CoatMaskMap: Same as in Lit Shaders.

EMISSION_OVERLAY:
_OverlayTiling: Tiling of the emission Overlay
_OverlayMap: Texture of the emission overlay
_OverlaySoftness: How soft the emission overlay is
_OverlayBrightness: How bright the emission overlay is (0-1)
_VoronoiMove: Emission overlay has voronoi to make it live. Voronoi speed.
_OverlayDirection: Which direction emission overlay moves.
_OverlayHorizontalMultiplier: how much less emission horizontally placed surfaces have.
_OverlayMoveDirection: Emission Overlay moves a bit. Which direction.
_OverlayMoveMultiplier: How much emission overlay moves.
_EffectOrigin: Where the overlay effect has started.
_EffectSpread: How much overlay effect has spread.
_BlendTextureAlbedo: Texture map for blending during burning etc.
_BlendTextureNormal: Texture normal map for blending during burning etc.
_BlendTextureNormalStrength: Blend texture normal map strength.
_BlendTextureLerpT: 0-1 how much the texture is blended to original texture.
_UseOverlay: If emission overlay is used.

DISSOLVE AND EMISSION_OVERLAY:
_OverlayColor: What color emission overlay has
_OverlayMaximumBrightness: Maximum brightness for the overlay.

DISSOLVE:
_UseDissolve: If Dissolve is used.
_DissolveEdgeWidth: how wide is the dissolve emission edge.
_DissolveOrigin: Where dissolve effect has started.
_DissolveSpread: How much dissolve effect has spread.

TEXTURE_OVERRIDE:
_UseTextureOverride: If texture override is used.
_OverrideAlbedo: Texture map for the override
_OverrideNormalMap: Texture Normal Map for the override
_OverrideTiling: Override texture tiling.
_OverrideOffset: Offset for override texture
_TextureOverlayOrigin: Where texture override is originated.
_TextureOverlaySpread: How much texture override has spread.

NULLIFY:
_NullifyOrigin: Where nullify is originated
_NullifySpread: How much nullify has spread



BASE:
_IsMagioShader: This is used to detect if this is indeed a magio shader.
_LifelineMultiplier: 1 if fadeOutStart_s is not reached. Linearly decreased to 0 according to fadeOutLength_s
