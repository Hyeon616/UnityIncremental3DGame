You can hook up Ignis to set the Vegetation Studio instances on fire by using Runtime prefab spawner.
First Enable Runtime Prefab Spawner from Vegetation Studio System instance.
Then add new rule for the spawner.
Then add Vegetation-Studio-Default-Tree/Bush from this folder to the Runtime prefab. 
(You can also create your own for any object after studying how it works)
Then tick Add Vegetation Item Scale.
Done! Invisible Flammable Object will now spawn to the root of your instance.
